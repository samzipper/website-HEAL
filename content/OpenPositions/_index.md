**Currently open positions:**

*Undergraduates:*
 - The KGS Applied Geohydrology Internship program will likely be recruiting two paid interns for the 2021 summer. The students will contribute to a KWRI-funded project investigating the hydrology and biogeochemistry of intermittent streams in the High Plains Aquifer and will be co-supervised by Sam, [Erin Seybold](https://www.erinseybold.com). and [Chi Zhang](https://www.chizhanggeophysics.com). These internships are open to students or recent graduates from any institution and will pay $7200 for a 12-week summer research experience. Watch for an advertisement in spring 2021.

*Graduate Students:*
 - There are no currently funded graduate student positions open in HEAL. However, I am always happy to work with interested students on developing proposals for external funding, such as the [NSF GRFP](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/), or internal KU fellowships, such as the [Self Fellowship](https://selfgraduate.ku.edu). If you are interested, please [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}).

*Postdocs:*
 - There are no currently funded postdoctoral positions open to join HEAL. If you are interested in the hydrogeology or ecohydrology of anthropogenic landscapes, I would be excited to work together to develop a mutually agreeable project and identify a suitable funding body. Options include the [NSF Earth Sciences postdoctoral fellowship (EAR-PF)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144) and the [SESYNC Socio-Environmental Immersion Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://www.sesync.org/opportunities/research-fellowships-postdoctoral-fellowships/socio-environmental-immersion-1) (based at SESYNC in Annapolis MD). If you are interested, please [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}).

*Visiting Scientists:*
 - We love to collaborate and one of our favorite ways is to host visiting students and scientists from other institutions. Lawrence is a beautiful place to visit, whether for a week or a year. If you need a visa, sponsor, or any other paperwork, we are happy to work with you to set things up. We will arrange comfortable office space with plenty of coffee and good conversations for anyone who comes by for a visit! If you want to visit sometime, please [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}).
