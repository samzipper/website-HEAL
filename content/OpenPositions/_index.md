**Interested in joining the HEAL@KGS research group?**

We love working with new people and value the skills that all members of HEAL@KGS bring to the table. There are numerous ways to join the group, whether you are based in Kansas or elsewhere. Please see below for opportunities at the undergraduate, graduate, postdoc, and visiting scientist levels.

Before you get in touch, please read [this article](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2015/05/dear-dr-neufeld) and [this blog post](https://contemplativemammoth.com/2013/04/08/so-you-want-to-go-to-grad-school-nail-the-inquiry-email/) for how to email a prospective advisor. While they are targeted towards people seeking graduate degrees, the points are relevant for people interested in any type of position.

If you are interested in a graduate position specifically, it is important to communicate with a potential advisor *before* you submit your official application to the university. While it may seem daunting, this can save you time and money because you won't bother pursuing programs where there is not a relevant advisor and/or funding available. It is usually best to start emailing prospective advisors at least one year in advance since there are multiple important deadlines that must be met, and this lead time increases the potential funding sources. This is true whether you are looking at KU or elsewhere.

**Currently open positions:**

*Undergraduates:*
 - The KGS Applied Geohydrology Internship program will likely be recruiting two paid interns for summer 2021. The students will contribute to a KWRI-funded project investigating the hydrology and biogeochemistry of intermittent streams in the High Plains Aquifer and will be co-supervised by Sam, [Erin Seybold](https://www.erinseybold.com). and [Chi Zhang](https://www.chizhanggeophysics.com). These internships are open to students or recent graduates from any institution and will pay $7200 for a 12-week summer research experience. Watch for an advertisement in spring 2021.

*Graduate Students:*
 - We anticipate advertising an NSF-funded Ph.D. position to begin Fall 2021. Watch for the advertistment on Twitter and elsewhere, sometime in Fall 2020. 
 - I can advise students through the [KU Department of Geology](https://geo.ku.edu/), and I am always happy to work with students on developing proposals for external funding, such as the [NSF GRFP](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/), or internal KU fellowships, such as the [Self Fellowship](https://selfgraduate.ku.edu). If you are interested, please [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}).

*Postdocs:*
 - There are no currently funded postdoctoral positions open to join HEAL. I would be excited to work together to develop a mutually agreeable project and identify a suitable funding body. Options include the [NSF Earth Sciences postdoctoral fellowship (EAR-PF)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144) and the [SESYNC Socio-Environmental Immersion Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://www.sesync.org/opportunities/research-fellowships-postdoctoral-fellowships/socio-environmental-immersion-1) (based at SESYNC in Annapolis MD). If you are interested, please [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}).

*Visiting Scientists:*
 - We love to collaborate and one of our favorite ways is to host visiting students and scientists from other institutions. Lawrence is a beautiful place to visit, whether for a week or a year. If you need a visa, sponsor, or any other paperwork, we are happy to work with you to set things up. We will arrange comfortable office space with plenty of coffee and good conversations for anyone who comes by for a visit! If you want to visit sometime, please [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}).
