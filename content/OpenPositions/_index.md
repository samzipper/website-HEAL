# Current positions

***Seeking Ph.D./M.S. student to begin fall 2020***
The HEAL@KGS research group, led by Sam Zipper, is seeking a graduate student to begin in Fall 2021 as part of the NSF-funded Aquatic Intermittency effects on Microbiomes in Streams (AIMS) project. This project seeks to develop interdisciplinary understanding of the hydrology, biogeochemistry, and microbial ecology of intermittent streams across the US. 

Within the project, this student's role will be to investigate groundwater-surface water interactions in intermittent streams during both flowing and dry phases. The student will both generate new understanding of the role of groundwater in intermittent streams, and also provide a hydrological basis for understanding biogeochemical and microbial processes, and therefore an interest in interdisciplinary research is essential. The research will include field-based research in Kansas and data synthesis spanning the Mountain West, Great Plains, and Southeastern Forest regions.

This position is ideal for someone interested in interdisciplinary, collaborative research, as it is one of 11 AIMS graduate positions across seven different institutions (**[see here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m6YGdQ0UECpEwRRReC0LfIUPkeB4mWA7aSmPR5OQssk/edit)** for information on all positions). All AIMS graduate students will take a cross-institutional Team Science and Collaboration course in their first year, receive support for instructor training through The Carpentries Foundation, have opportunities to mentor undergraduate research projects, and will work with an amazing team of scientists from the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, Idaho State University, University of Alabama, University of Mississippi, University of Southern Mississippi, and Haskell Indian Nations University. 

## To Apply
**If interested in the position**, please [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}) with the following items *as a single PDF*:
 - Cover letter (max 2 pages) describing interest in the position, and how you meet the required/preferred qualifications (below)
 - C.V. or resume
 - Undergrad/graduate transcripts (unofficial)
Review of applications will begin **October 19 2020**, but will continue until a suitable candidate is found. Promising candidate(s) will then be encouraged to apply to the [KU Department of Geology](https://geo.ku.edu/)'s graduate program.

## Required qualifications
 - Coursework in hydrogeology, hydrology, ecohydrology, or other water-focused research
 - Ability to work well indepedently and as part of a team
 - Excellent written and oral communication skills

## Preferred qualifications
 - Field-based hydrogeology and/or hydrology research experience
 - Experience with script-based data analysis (Python, R, etc.)

## Position benefits and details
 - This position will begin in summer/fall of 2020. 
 - The student's research home will be the [Kansas Geological Survey](http://www.kgs.ku.edu/) and their academic home will be the [KU Department of Geology](https://geo.ku.edu/). Through these multiple homes (which are both on KU's campus), the student will gain access to a wide professional network across diverse career paths. 
 - This position will be supported with a graduate research assistantship (for at least 3 years) and teaching assistantship (if additional time required). This includes tuition remission, an annual stipend, and funding to present research at local and international conferences and visit project collaborators and field sites. 
 - The student will be based in Lawrence KS, which is an eclectic town of ~90,000 people with an excellent cultural and food scene. Recreational opportunities abound including biking, hiking, and boating around town, and the big-city vibes of Kansas City are just an hour away.

# General information about other opportunities

**Interested in joining the HEAL@KGS research group?**

We love working with new people and value the skills that all members of HEAL@KGS bring to the table. There are numerous ways to join the group, whether you are based in Kansas or elsewhere. Please see below for opportunities at the undergraduate, graduate, postdoc, and visiting scientist levels.

Before you get in touch, please read [this article](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2015/05/dear-dr-neufeld) and [this blog post](https://contemplativemammoth.com/2013/04/08/so-you-want-to-go-to-grad-school-nail-the-inquiry-email/) for how to email a prospective advisor. While they are targeted towards people seeking graduate degrees, the points are relevant for people interested in any type of position.

If you are interested in a graduate position specifically, it is important to communicate with a potential advisor *before* you submit your official application to the university. While it may seem daunting, this can save you time and money because you won't bother pursuing programs where there is not a relevant advisor and/or funding available. It is usually best to start emailing prospective advisors at least one year in advance since there are multiple important deadlines that must be met, and this lead time increases the potential funding sources. This is true whether you are looking at KU or elsewhere.

**Currently open positions:**

*Undergraduates:*
 - The KGS Applied Geohydrology Internship program will likely be recruiting two paid interns for summer 2021. The students will contribute to a KWRI-funded project investigating the hydrology and biogeochemistry of intermittent streams in the High Plains Aquifer and will be co-supervised by Sam, [Erin Seybold](https://www.erinseybold.com). and [Chi Zhang](https://www.chizhanggeophysics.com). These internships are open to students or recent graduates from any institution and will pay $7200 for a 12-week summer research experience. Watch for an advertisement in spring 2021.

*Graduate Students:*
 - There is an opening for an NSF-funded graduate student (see top of page).
 - I can advise students through the [KU Department of Geology](https://geo.ku.edu/), and I am always happy to work with students on developing proposals for external funding, such as the [NSF GRFP](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/), or internal KU fellowships, such as the [Self Fellowship](https://selfgraduate.ku.edu). If you are interested, please [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}).

*Postdocs:*
 - There are no currently funded postdoctoral positions open to join HEAL. I would be excited to work together to develop a mutually agreeable project and identify a suitable funding body. Options include the [NSF Earth Sciences postdoctoral fellowship (EAR-PF)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144) and the [SESYNC Socio-Environmental Immersion Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://www.sesync.org/opportunities/research-fellowships-postdoctoral-fellowships/socio-environmental-immersion-1) (based at SESYNC in Annapolis MD). If you are interested, please [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}).

*Visiting Scientists:*
 - We love to collaborate and one of our favorite ways is to host visiting students and scientists from other institutions. Lawrence is a beautiful place to visit, whether for a week or a year. If you need a visa, sponsor, or any other paperwork, we are happy to work with you to set things up. We will arrange comfortable office space with plenty of coffee and good conversations for anyone who comes by for a visit! If you want to visit sometime, please [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}).
