<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>This is the fourth edition of my time tracking analysis, adding in the 2023 calendar years. Past versions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.samzipper.com/post/2021-01-02_how-much-do-i-work/">2019-2020 initial analysis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.samzipper.com/post/2022-01-02-work-tracking-update/">2019-2021 follow-up</a></li>
<li><a href="https://samzipper.com/post/2023-01-02-work-tracking-update.html">2019-2022 follow-up</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Targets for 2023 included:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Disconnecting:</em>
<ul>
<li>Minimum of 1/day week with no work</li>
<li>Maximum of 1 day/week with evening work</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Time allocation:</em>
<ul>
<li>Average 20% time research</li>
<li>&lt;= 1 day/month field work.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The hours are tracked in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ob3Ncsa_6ttzFWDB2FSn-NEEeSbKFZ2E7-P2qkWL48/edit#gid=244257672">simple google sheet</a> at 30 min resolution and divided into a few simple categories:
- <code>talking</code> = things that involved other people… meetings, seminars, zoom calls, etc.
- <code>logistics</code> = stuff that is generally unimportant (but sometimes necessary). emails, expense reports, etc.
- <code>research</code> = writing proposals or papers, making presentations, data analysis, reading papers, etc.
- <code>mentees</code> = talking to or working with someone who I am mentoring such as a postdoc or student, including reviewing their work
- <code>conference</code> = anything at a conference/workshop. I define it broadly so it includes going out for meals with colleagues, etc. - basically, any time I am in the presence of other people.
- <code>service</code> = journal or grant reviews, committees, open science stuff, etc.</p>

<h1>Baseline stats: How much do I work?</h1>
<p>My typical weekly workload remains consistent, with a median of 40 hours weekly:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2024-01-01-work-tracking-update_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="576" /></p>
<p>After account for time off by dividing total hours worked over number of work days, I’ve had a slight increase to 8.5 in 2023, up from 8.3 hours in 2022 but still down from my peak of 9.5 when I started tracking in 2019:</p>

<h1>Key goals/indicators</h1>
<div id="no-work-on-days-off" class="section level2">
<h2>1. No work on days off</h2>
<p>I set this goal at the beginning of 2021, after observing that I often was checking/responding to email on weekends. I’ve made continued improvements here each of the past three years, and am up to 82 days with absolutely no work in 2023.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2024-01-01-work-tracking-update_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="384" /></p>
<p>Looking weekly, this means there was at least one day completely off in 46 weeks. Since there are only 52 weeks in the year, minimal improvement is possible here, but I can aim for more weeks with at least two days completely off (i.e., both weekend days) - in 2023, I only had 17 weeks where I took two days off. This would require shifting my week planning from it’s current timeslot (Sunday after lunch) to the end of the prior week (Friday afternoon).</p>

<div id="do-more-research-and-less-logistics" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Do more research and less logistics</h2>
<p>In 2023, I worked basically the exact same number of hours as 2022 (1867 hours), with basically flat percent of my time allocated to logistics + talking (just over half, at 50.6%). However, my percent time for research did jump from 10.8% in 2022 to 15.4% in 2023, with a smaller jump for mentees (18.6% to 20.1%). These increases were compensated for by minor decreases in field work, service, and teaching. So, trending in the right direction.</p>

<div id="less-evening-work" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Less evening work</h2>
<p>There remains a pretty clear seasonal pattern for evening work, with the most activity during the semester and less over the summer. In 2023, there were clear peaks in June (associated with a proposal deadline) and October/November (associated with teaching).</p>
<p><img src="/post/2024-01-01-work-tracking-update_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="576" /></p>
<p>In 2023, I was aiming for &lt;= 1 day/week with evening work, as I thought that would be an easier goal to keep on top of than 10 hrs/week (my previous goal), and it looked like the shift in goal was effective. I’m up to 28 weeks in 2023 with &lt;= 1 day/week with evening work. So, while there hasn’t been a big shift in terms of hours, it has been concentrated into a smaller number of days, leaving more evenings completely free.</p>

<div id="maximum-24-total-field-work-days." class="section level2">
<h2>4. Maximum 24 total field work days.</h2>
<p>The number of days I spent out in the field has continued to decrease from its high point in 2021, due primarily to a decrease in the field work requirements due to some projects ending and others reaching relatively stable conditions focused on field maintenance, rather than new field installations.</p>

<div id="any-updates-for-2024" class="section level1">
<h1>Any updates for 2024?</h1>
<p>Most goals will remain the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain 1/day week with no work and increase number of weeks with at least 2 days/week with no work.</li>
<li>Maximum of 1 day/week with evening work</li>
<li>Maintain research time at least 15% with target of 20%.</li>
</ul>
