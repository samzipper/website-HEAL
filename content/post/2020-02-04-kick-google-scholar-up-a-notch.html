<p>(If you just want the code, <a href="https://github.com/samzipper/SelfAnalysis/blob/master/PlotPubsAndCitations.R">go here</a>.)</p>
<p>Maybe you’re applying for a job or going up for tenure, and are trying to demonstrate your research output in a unique way. In academia, the number of publications and citations are commonly used as indicators of productivity and influence - the hypothesis being that productive people are writing more papers and influential people are being cited more. The <a href="https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/is-it-time-to-bury-the-h-index/">limitations</a> of these <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/four-great-reasons-to-stop-caring-so-much-about-the-h-index/">metrics</a> have <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/nautilus/2007/10/the_hindex_has_its_flaws.html">long been noted</a>, so I won’t belabor them here.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some people in positions of power care about publications and citations, so we might as well show these metrics in a user-friendly manner. I like making graphs so I decided to put a couple simple graphs on the front page of my CV. Since one of the critiques of citation analysis is that it doesn’t account for different authorship roles, I wanted to separately show the data for papers on which I was the first author since I made the primary intellectual contribution for those studies. I don’t know if putting graphs in CVs is normal, but I was complimented on it during multiple job interviews, so in the end I’m glad I bothered.</p>
<p>Let’s set up our environment. We’ll use the <a href="https://github.com/jkeirstead/scholar"><code>scholar</code> package</a> to get the data, then rearrange it a bit with <code>dplyr</code>, <code>reshape2</code>, and <code>stringr</code>, and finally plot with <code>ggplot2</code>. So, let’s load some packages!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>require(scholar)  # interface with google scholar
require(ggplot2)  # for plotting
require(dplyr)    # for data tidying
require(stringr)  # for working with string data</code></pre>
<p>To get your data from Google Scholar, first you have to determine your Google Scholar ID. You can get this from the characters after the <code>=</code> in your Google Scholar URL. For instance, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XXIpO1YAAAAJ">my Google Scholar URL</a> is <code>https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XXIpO1YAAAAJ</code>, so I know my ID is <code>XXIpO1YAAAAJ</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>me &lt;- &quot;XXIpO1YAAAAJ&quot;</code></pre>
<p>It’s easy to get a list of all your publications using the <code>get_publications()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pubs_raw &lt;- 
  scholar::get_publications(me)</code></pre>
<p>While Google Scholar’s great, it makes some mistakes. For accuracy’s sake I’ll do a little cleaning up of this list. Specifically, I want to: (1) remove any non-journal articles such as theses; (2) remove anypre-prints that have not gone through peer review yet; and (3) adjust the years for an article that were published as preprints in 2019 but actually published in 2020 - Google Scholar puts these in the year the preprint was posted.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pubs &lt;-
  pubs_raw %&gt;% 
  # (1) remove theses; these don&#39;t have a year
  subset(is.finite(year)) %&gt;% 
  # (2) get rid of preprints - all mine are on EarthArXiv
  subset(journal != &quot;EarthArXiv&quot;)

# (3) update year - figure out the pubid by looking at the pubs_raw data frame
pubs$year[pubs$pubid == &quot;fQNAKQ3IYiAC&quot;] &lt;- 2020</code></pre>
<p>The <code>author</code> field has a comma-separated list of all the authors for each publication. Since I want to separately plot publications I first-authored, I need to isolate the first author for each paper:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pubs$first_author &lt;- 
  # the &#39;author&#39; column is a factor by default, so first convert to character
  pubs$author %&gt;% 
  as.character() %&gt;% 
  # split based on commas and grab the first author only
  strsplit(split=&quot;[,]&quot;) %&gt;% 
  sapply(function(x) x[1])

# look at the results
pubs$first_author</code></pre>

<p>Uh-oh! I’m referred to as both “S Zipper” and “SC Zipper”. Fortunately, I don’t have any co-authors named Zipper, so I will claim anything including Zipper. If you have a more common last name, you might have to refine your search here.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_name &lt;- &quot;Zipper&quot;

pubs$first_author_me &lt;-
  pubs$first_author %&gt;% 
  stringr::str_detect(pattern = my_name)</code></pre>
<p>We now have my publication history, and for every paper we know whether I am the first author or not. You can refine your search even more - for example, if you are a PI, you may want to create an additional category for publications by your students. You’d just need to remember their names.</p>
<p>Now, let’s work on the citations. The <code>pubid</code> field can be used to get annual citations for each of my publications. We’ll loop through all my papers, extract the citations by year, and put them into a big data frame. There’s probably a vectorized way to do this with <code>apply</code> but I didn’t bother because I don’t have that many papers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for (i in 1:length(pubs$pubid)){
  # grab citations for this paper
  paper_cites &lt;- 
    scholar::get_article_cite_history(id = me, 
                                      article = pubs$pubid[i])
  
  # make master data frame
  if (i == 1){
    all_cites &lt;- paper_cites
  } else {
    all_cites &lt;- rbind(all_cites, paper_cites)
  }
}

head(all_cites)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   year cites        pubid
## 1 2017    13 cFHS6HbyZ2cC
## 2 2018    19 cFHS6HbyZ2cC
## 3 2019    31 cFHS6HbyZ2cC
## 4 2020     7 cFHS6HbyZ2cC
## 5 2017    14 3s1wT3WcHBgC
## 6 2018    15 3s1wT3WcHBgC</code></pre>
<p>Now we know the annual citations for each paper, and can join it with <code>pubs</code> to add information about the first author.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>all_cites &lt;- 
  dplyr::left_join(all_cites,
                   pubs[, c(&quot;pubid&quot;, &quot;first_author_me&quot;)],
                   by=&quot;pubid&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s just re-arrange a bit to prepare for plotting.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># for the plots, we want annual sums
pubs_yr &lt;-
  pubs %&gt;% 
  dplyr::group_by(year, first_author_me) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::summarize(number = n(),            # could use any field
                   metric = &quot;Publications&quot;) # this will come in handy later
cites_yr &lt;-
  all_cites %&gt;% 
  dplyr::group_by(year, first_author_me) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::summarize(number = sum(cites),
                   metric = &quot;Citations&quot;)

# to make a faceted plot, we&#39;ll want to combine these into a single data frame
pubs_and_cites &lt;- rbind(pubs_yr, cites_yr)</code></pre>
<p>Finally - let’s make some graphs!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(pubs_and_cites, aes(x=factor(year), y=number, fill=first_author_me)) +
  geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) +
  facet_wrap(~factor(metric, levels=c(&quot;Publications&quot;, &quot;Citations&quot;)),
             scales = &quot;free_y&quot;) +
  # everything below here is just aesthetics
  scale_x_discrete(name = &quot;Year&quot;) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = &quot;Number&quot;) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = &quot;First Author&quot;, 
                    values = c(&quot;TRUE&quot;=&quot;#e6194b&quot;, &quot;FALSE&quot;=&quot;#0082c8&quot;),
                    labels = c(&quot;TRUE&quot;=&quot;Zipper&quot;, &quot;FALSE&quot;=&quot;Other&quot;)) +
  theme_bw(base_size=12) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_blank(),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 11, face=&quot;bold&quot;),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 10, face=&quot;bold&quot;),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 10, face=&quot;bold&quot;),
        legend.position = c(0.01,0.99),
        legend.justification = c(0, 1))</code></pre>

<p>Voila! Now, you can add it to your CV, or just print it out and hang it on the wall above your bed (I don’t judge).</p>
