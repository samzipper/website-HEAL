Maybe you're applying for a job or going up for tenure, and are trying to demonstrate your research output in a unique way. In academia, the number of publications and citations are commonly used as indicators of productivity and influence - the hypothesis being that productive people are writing more papers and influential people are being cited more. The [limitations](https://thebibliomagician.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/is-it-time-to-bury-the-h-index/) of these [metrics](http://blog.impactstory.org/four-great-reasons-to-stop-caring-so-much-about-the-h-index/) have [long been noted](http://blogs.nature.com/nautilus/2007/10/the_hindex_has_its_flaws.html), so I won't belabor them here. 

Nevertheless, some people in positions of power care about publications and citations, so we might as well show these metrics in a user-friendly manner. I like making graphs so I decided to put a couple simple graphs on the front page of my CV. Since one of the critiques of citation analysis is that it doesn't account for different authorship roles, I wanted to separately show the data for papers on which I was the first author since I made the primary intellectual contribution for those studies. I don't know if putting graphs in CVs is normal, but I was complimented on it during multiple job interviews, so in the end I'm glad I bothered.

Let's set up our environment. We'll use the [`scholar` package](https://github.com/jkeirstead/scholar) to get the data, then rearrange it a bit with `dplyr`, `reshape2`, and `stringr`, and finally plot with `ggplot2`. So, let's load some packages!

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(scholar)  # interface with google scholar
require(ggplot2)  # for plotting
require(dplyr)    # for data tidying
require(stringr)  # for working with string data
```

To get your data from Google Scholar, first you have to determine your Google Scholar ID. You can get this from the characters after the `=` in your Google Scholar URL. For instance, [my Google Scholar URL](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XXIpO1YAAAAJ) is `https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XXIpO1YAAAAJ`, so I know my ID is `XXIpO1YAAAAJ`.

```{r}
me <- "XXIpO1YAAAAJ"
```

It's easy to get a list of all your publications using the `get_publications()` function:

```{r}
pubs_raw <- 
  scholar::get_publications(me)
```

While Google Scholar's great, it makes some mistakes. For accuracy's sake I'll do a little cleaning up of this list. Specifically, I want to: (1) remove any non-journal articles such as theses; (2) remove anypre-prints that have not gone through peer review yet; and (3) adjust the years for an article that were published as preprints in 2019 but actually published in 2020 - Google Scholar puts these in the year the preprint was posted.

```{r}
pubs <-
  pubs_raw %>% 
  # (1) remove theses; these don't have a year
  subset(is.finite(year)) %>% 
  # (2) get rid of preprints - all mine are on EarthArXiv
  subset(journal != "EarthArXiv")

# (3) update year - figure out the pubid by looking at the pubs_raw data frame
pubs$year[pubs$pubid == "fQNAKQ3IYiAC"] <- 2020
```

The `author` field has a comma-separated list of all the authors for each publication. Since I want to separately plot publications I first-authored, I need to isolate the first author for each paper:

```{r}
pubs$first_author <- 
  # the 'author' column is a factor by default, so first convert to character
  pubs$author %>% 
  as.character() %>% 
  # split based on commas and grab the first author only
  strsplit(split="[,]") %>% 
  sapply(function(x) x[1])

# look at the results
pubs$first_author
```

Uh-oh! I'm referred to as both "S Zipper" and "SC Zipper". Fortunately, I don't have any co-authors named Zipper, so I will claim anything including Zipper. If you have a more common last name, you might have to refine your search here.

```{r}
my_name <- "Zipper"

pubs$first_author_me <-
  pubs$first_author %>% 
  stringr::str_detect(pattern = my_name)
```

We now have my publication history, and for every paper we know whether I am the first author or not. You can refine your search even more - for example, if you are a PI, you may want to create an additional category for publications by your students. You'd just need to remember their names.

Now, let's work on the citations. The `pubid` field can be used to get annual citations for each of my publications. We'll loop through all my papers, extract the citations by year, and put them into a big data frame. There's probably a vectorized way to do this with `apply` but I didn't bother because I don't have that many papers.

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(pubs$pubid)){
  # grab citations for this paper
  paper_cites <- 
    scholar::get_article_cite_history(id = me, 
                                      article = pubs$pubid[i])
  
  # make master data frame
  if (i == 1){
    all_cites <- paper_cites
  } else {
    all_cites <- rbind(all_cites, paper_cites)
  }
}

head(all_cites)
```

Now we know the annual citations for each paper, and can join it with `pubs` to add information about the first author.

```{r}
all_cites <- 
  dplyr::left_join(all_cites,
                   pubs[, c("pubid", "first_author_me")],
                   by="pubid")
```

Let's just re-arrange a bit to prepare for plotting.

```{r}
# for the plots, we want annual sums
pubs_yr <-
  pubs %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(year, first_author_me) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(number = n(),            # could use any field
                   metric = "Publications") # this will come in handy later
cites_yr <-
  all_cites %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(year, first_author_me) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(number = sum(cites),
                   metric = "Citations")

# to make a faceted plot, we'll want to combine these into a single data frame
pubs_and_cites <- rbind(pubs_yr, cites_yr)
```

Finally - let's make some graphs!

```{r}
ggplot(pubs_and_cites, aes(x=factor(year), y=number, fill=first_author_me)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  facet_wrap(~factor(metric, levels=c("Publications", "Citations")),
             scales = "free_y") +
  # everything below here is just aesthetics
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Year") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Number") +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "First Author", 
                    values = c("TRUE"="#e6194b", "FALSE"="#0082c8"),
                    labels = c("TRUE"="Zipper", "FALSE"="Other")) +
  theme_bw(base_size=12) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_blank(),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 11, face="bold"),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 10, face="bold"),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 10, face="bold"),
        legend.position = c(0.01,0.99),
        legend.justification = c(0, 1))
```

Voila! Now, you can add it to your CV, or just print it out and hang it on the wall above your bed (I don't judge).
