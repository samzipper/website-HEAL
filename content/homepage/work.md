The goal of HEAL is to quantify the current condition of the water resources of Kansas and the Great Plains region, and understand how local, regional, and global change drivers can and will affect these water resources in the future. Our science will be useful, intelligible, and actionable for diverse stakeholders including policymakers, farmers, the agricultural industry, conservation groups, and city planners. In addition to local research, we seek to understand how socio-environmental systems around the world experience and respond to similar water challenges to those facing the Kansas and the Great Plains today and connect these global insights to local challenges. To accomplish this mission, we will collaborate with physical and social scientists around the world in addition to the local stakeholders mentioned previously; share all scientific methods, tools, and results openly; and continually move towards the intersection of scientific novelty and societal relevance.
