# HEAL@KGS values

HEAL@KGS is unequivocally committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) at an individual and collective level. Our mission is to improve fundamental and applied understanding of water resources and the societies they support, which requires understanding, respecting, and working with the societies that these water resources support. Regardless of our scientific goals, working to advance DEI is also a moral imperative.

As part of [#ShutDownSTEM](https://www.shutdownstem.com/), Sam identified five specific, actionable steps he has or will take to advance these values:
 1. Just like scientific research, upholding our DEI goals requires an investment of sustained effort. I will integrate DEI actions into my own Individual Development Plan (IDP) and the IDPs that each trainee completes and revisits throughout their time in the group to ensure we are continually making progress.
 2. Racial and gender bias [affects academic hiring decisions](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2019/06/racial-and-gender-biases-plague-postdoc-hiring). I will minimize bias in hiring for all positions (undergraduate, graduate, postdoc, intern) by writing inclusive job descriptions, standardizing interview questions, using an evaluation rubric, and having a diverse group participate in the interview process. ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2019/02/20/how-to-minimize-unconscious-bias-during-recruitment))
 3. Preventing discrimination and harassment in the workplace is all of our jobs. I will complete [bystander intervention training](https://sapec.ku.edu/bystander) and put the practices we learn to use.
 4. Volunteer research experiences [exclude people who cannot afford to work for free](https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wsb.603), which disproportionately disadvantages minorities and other groups currently underrepresented in the sciences. We will write in salary for all necessary employees to grant budgets, and if we cannot afford to pay an employee, we will not hire them.
 5. In academia, citations are how we show someone's work is important and useful, and are often used in hiring/promotion decisions. My own citations are [disproportionately weighted towards men](https://twitter.com/ZipperSam/status/990722168370556928). I will seek out diverse voices through various platforms (such as social media and conferences), read their work, and cite it where relevant.

I acknowledge that I am still learning and, as a white scholar from an upper-middle class background, can never fully understand the experiences of Black, Indigenous, immigrant, and other people of color. Nevertheless, I will continue to educate myself, listen, and change. 

# Code of conduct

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure an that everyone has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any HEAL@KGS project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all time.

Sam Zipper, as head of HEAL@KGS, and all lab members, are dedicated to a ***harassment-free experience for everyone***, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. **We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form**.

We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

 - All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.
 - Be kind to others. Criticizing ideas (in a respectful and constructive manner) is OK. Criticizing people is never OK.
 - Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
 - Make an inclusive environment for everyone. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.
 - Respect your fellow lab-mates. Respect their strengths and weaknesses, respect their desire for quiet if they need it, and for support and a kind ear when they need that. Respect their culture, their religion, their beliefs, their sexual orientation.
 - Watch out for [microaggressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression). Be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others or contribute to a negative environment even if you had no intent of harm. Listen. Offer a genuine apology. Commit to learning and doing better.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

***Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.***

Members of the community who violate these rules - no matter how much they have contributed to the HEAL@KGS, or how specialised their skill set - will be approached by Sam Zipper. If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with Sam, the contributor will be asked to discontinue their participation in Whitaker lab projects.

**To report an issue** - please contact [Sam]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}). All communication will be treated as confidential. However, please note that Sam (along with most other KU employees) is a [mandatory reporter](https://provost.ku.edu/memos/20151110) and is therefore required to report incidents of discrimination and sexual harassment to the [KU Office of Institutional Opportunity and Access (IOA)](https://ioa.ku.edu/). IOA maintains a list of [confidential support resources](https://ioa.ku.edu/campus-community-support-resources) if you have an issue you would like to discuss without reporting to the IOA.

# Expectations for lab members

## Everyone

Science is hard. But it’s also fun. We want to make sure that everyone experiences a positive, engaging, hostility-free, challenging, and rewarding lab environment. To maintain that environment, we all have to do a few things.

 - Work on what you’re passionate about, work hard at it, and be proud of it. Be so proud of it that you have to suppress bragging (but it’s ok to brag sometimes).
 - Scientists have to be careful. Don’t rush your work. Think about it. Implement it. Double and triple check it. Incorporate sanity checks. Ask others to look at your code or data if you need help or something looks off. It’s ok to makes mistakes, but mistakes shouldn’t be because of carelessness or rushed work.
 - If you do make a mistake, you should definitely tell your collaborators (if they have already seen the results, and especially if the paper is being written up, is already submitted, or already accepted). We admit our mistakes, and then we correct them and move on.
 - We all want to get papers published and do great things. But we do this honestly. It is never ok to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in any way. Science is about finding out the truth, and null results and unexpected results are still important. This can’t be emphasized enough: no academic misconduct!
 - Support your colleagues. Help them out if they need help (even if you aren’t on the project), and let them vent when they need to. Science is collaborative, not competitive. Help others, and you can expect others to help you when you need it.
 - If you’re struggling, tell someone (feel free to tell Sam!). Your health and happiness come first. The lab looks out for the well-being of all its members. We are here to help. It’s ok to go through hard patches (we all do), but you shouldn’t feel shy about asking for help or just venting.
 - If there is any tension or hostility in the lab, something has to be done about it immediately. We can’t thrive in an environment we aren’t comfortable in, and disrespect or rudeness will not be tolerated in the lab. If you don’t feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell Sam. In any case, tell Sam.
 - If you have a problem with Sam and are comfortable telling him about it, please do! If you aren’t comfortable talking to Sam, talk to Annette Delaney (KGS human resources director) or someone else that you feel comfortable talking to.
 - Stay up to date on the latest research through journal table of contents and/or following scientists in the field on Twitter. But don't let social media take over your life - maintain focused time for [deep work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/).
 - If you’re sick, stay home and take care of yourself. Because you need it, and also because others don’t need to get sick. If you’re sick, reschedule your meetings and participants for the day (or the next couple of days) as soon as you can.
 - Be on time for your meetings: respect that others have packed days and everyone’s time is valuable. 
 - Keep your office and any shared work spaces (conference room, kitchen, labs) tidy, clean, and uncluttered. Turn off the lights when you leave a room.
 - Backup your data and scripts regularly. Like, every day without thinking about it. The University of Kansas provides 1 TB free space on OneDrive – you should use it. If your computer explodes overnight, you should be able to get up and running within an hour on a new computer the next day. 
 - Have a life outside of the lab, take care of your mental and physical health, and don’t ever feel bad for taking time off work. You aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night. You are expected to get your work done (whatever time of day you like to do it). See 'Working Hours' section for more.

## Principal Investigator

All of the above, and I promise to also…
 - Support you (scientifically, emotionally, financially)
 - Give you feedback on a timely basis, including feedback on project ideas, conference posters, talks, manuscripts, figures, grants
 - Be available in person and via e-mail on a regular basis, including regular meetings to discuss your research (and anything else you’d like to discuss)
 - Give my perspective on where the lab is going, where the field is going, and tips about surviving and thriving in academia
 - Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, promoting your work at talks, writing recommendation letters for you, and letting you attend conferences as often as finances permit
 - Help you prepare for the next step of your career, whether it’s a post-doc, a faculty job, or a job outside of academia
 - Care for your emotional and physical well-being, and prioritize that above all else

## Post-Docs

All of the above, and you will also be expected to…
 - Develop your own independent line of research
 - Help train and mentor students in the lab (both undergraduate and graduate) when they need it – either because they ask, or because I ask you to
 - Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences
 - Apply for grants. Though I will only hire you if I can support you for at least one year, it’s in your best interest to get experience writing grants – and if you get them you’ll be helping out the entire lab as well as yourself (because you’ll free up funds previously allocated to you)
 - Apply for jobs (academic or otherwise) when you’re ready, but no later than the beginning of your final funded year as a post-doc. If you think you’d like to leave academia, that’s completely ok – but you should still treat your post-doc seriously, and talk to me about how to best train for a job outside academia
 - You were hired because you have unique skills and knowledge. Challenge me (Sam) when I’m wrong or when your opinion is different, and treat the rest of the lab to your unique expertise 


## Graduate Students

All of the above, and you will also be expected to…
 - Develop your dissertation research. Your dissertation should have at least 3 substantial chapters that answer a big-picture question that you have. Much of your work has to be done independently, but remember that others in lab (especially Sam!) are there to help you when you need it
 - Help mentor undergraduate students in the lab when they need it – either because they ask, or because I ask you to. Undergrads can also help you collect data. 
 - Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences
 - Apply for grants. It’s a valuable experience, and best to get it early.
 - Think about what you want for your career (academia – research or teaching, industry, science writing, something else), and talk to Sam about it to make sure you’re getting the training you need for that career
 - Make sure you meet all departmental deadlines (e.g., for your exams and thesis) -- and make sure Sam and your academic supervisor is aware of them!
 - Prioritize time for research. Coursework and TAing are important, but ultimately your research gets you your PhD and prepares you for the next stage of your career.

## Undergraduate Students

All of the above, and you will also be expected to…
 - Assist other lab members with data collection and analysis (unless you are working on your own independent project under the mentorship of another lab member, in which case you should work on that)
 - Develop your weekly schedule by talking to your mentor (a graduate student, a post-doc, or Sam). You should be coming in every week, and scheduling enough time to get your work done
 - If you are earning course credit for research, you must also attend lab meetings when your schedule permits, present at one of these lab meetings, and submit a write-up of your research by the end of the semester

## Visiting Scientists, Students, and Interns

All of the above, and you will also be expected to…
 - Share your expertise with other members of the lab - we are excited to have you as a guest and learn from you!
 - Abide by the code of conduct

# Lab policies and guidelines

## Authorship
Authorship is an important and sometimes thorny consideration, particularly for lab members pursuing academic careers. In order to be an author, you must have made an intellectual contribution to the work, and be able to defend the work in public. However, defining what constitutes an “intellectual contribution” is often not straightforward. Therefore, it is useful to clarify and have a common set of standards agreed upon among lab members.

Our goal is to be be inclusive of all project participants, to offer junior members leadership roles on papers, and to freely share our data. If you are leading a study or publication, you should provide opportunities for other people to contribute. If you are contributing to a publication, you should expect to be a co-author if you meet at least two of the following criteria: 
 - Significant intellectual contribution to the concept and hypotheses of the research 
 - Significant intellectual contribution to the design and presentation of the research and analyses 
 - Supervision regarding the organization and progress of the manuscript 
 - Provision of data, materials, or additional resources necessary for the project 
 - Responsibility for data collection, analysis, and presentation of results 
 - Substantial contribution in writing the manuscript (writing, figures, etc.) 
As a co-author, you must also provide critical and constructive review of manuscript drafts prior to submission, and you should be able to explain and defend the methods and results in the paper and should generally agree with them.

## Working hours

The hours that members of the lab choose to work is up to them. We are each welcome to send work-related emails during non-traditional work hours (evenings, weekends), but no lab members are required to reply to them outside of their typical work hours.

Lab members are welcome to work flexibly for any reason. There are some activities which require coordinated schedules (i.e,. group meetings and meetings with Sam/other group members/collaborators). Other than these, it is expected that every member of HEAL@KGS is already self-motivated and doesn't need to work a traditional 9 to 5 day in order to meet their goals.

If you struggle with working flexibly - working too much, working too little, feeling directionless - let Sam know and we can develop a flexible work plan together.
