# HEAL@KGS values

HEAL@KGS is unequivocally committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) at an individual and collective level. Our mission is to improve fundamental and applied understanding of water resources and the societies they support, which requires understanding, respecting, and working with diverse communities. Regardless of our scientific goals, working to advance DEI is also a moral imperative.

As part of [#ShutDownSTEM](https://www.shutdownstem.com/), Sam identified five specific, actionable steps he has taken or will take to advance these values:
 1. Just like scientific research, upholding our DEI goals requires a sustained investment of effort. I will integrate DEI actions into my own Individual Development Plan (IDP) and the IDPs that each lab member completes and revisits throughout their time in the group to ensure we are continually making effort and progress.
 2. Racial and gender bias [affects academic hiring decisions](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2019/06/racial-and-gender-biases-plague-postdoc-hiring). I will minimize bias in hiring for all positions (undergraduate, graduate, postdoc, intern) by writing inclusive job descriptions, standardizing interview questions, using an evaluation rubric, and having a diverse group participate in the interview process. ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2019/02/20/how-to-minimize-unconscious-bias-during-recruitment))
 3. Preventing discrimination and harassment in the workplace is all of our jobs. I will complete [bystander intervention training](https://sapec.ku.edu/bystander) and put the practices we learn to use.
 4. Volunteer research experiences [exclude people who cannot afford to work for free](https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wsb.603), which disproportionately disadvantages minorities and other groups currently underrepresented in the sciences. We will write in salary for all necessary employees to grant budgets, and if we cannot afford to pay an employee, we will not find someone to work for free.
 5. In academia, citations are how we show someone's work is important and useful, and are often used in hiring/promotion decisions. My own citations [are heavily skewed male](https://twitter.com/ZipperSam/status/990722168370556928). I will seek out diverse voices through various platforms (such as social media and conferences), read their published work, and cite it where relevant.

I acknowledge that I am still learning and, as a white scholar from an upper-middle class background, can never fully understand the experiences of Black, Indigenous, immigrant, and other people of color. Nevertheless, I will continue to educate myself, listen, and change. 

# Code of conduct

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure an that everyone has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any HEAL@KGS project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all time.

Sam Zipper, as head of HEAL@KGS, and all lab members, are dedicated to a ***harassment-free experience for everyone***, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. **We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form**.

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of HEAL@KGS and our collaborators to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

 - All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.
 - Be kind to others. Criticizing ideas (in a respectful and constructive manner) is OK. Criticizing people is never OK.
 - Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
 - Make an inclusive environment for everyone. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.
 - Respect your colleagues. Respect their strengths and weaknesses, respect their desire for quiet if they need it, and for support and a kind ear when they need that. Respect their culture, their religion, their beliefs, their sexual orientation - respect them.
 - Watch out for [microaggressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression). Be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others or contribute to a negative environment even if you had no intent of harm. Listen. Offer a genuine apology. Commit to learning and doing better.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members of the community who violate these rules will be approached by Sam and asked to do better. ***Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.*** If inappropriate behavior persists after a discussion with Sam, the contributor will be asked to discontinue their participation in HEAL@KGS projects.

**To report an issue** - please contact [Sam]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}). All communication will be treated as confidential. However, please know that Sam (along with most other KU employees) is a [mandatory reporter](https://provost.ku.edu/memos/20151110) and is therefore legally required to report incidents of discrimination and sexual harassment to the [KU Office of Institutional Opportunity and Access (IOA)](https://ioa.ku.edu/). IOA maintains a list of [confidential support resources](https://ioa.ku.edu/campus-community-support-resources) if you have an issue you would like to discuss without reporting to the IOA.

# Expectations for lab members

Science is hard. But it’s also fun. We want to make sure that everyone has a positive, engaging, hostility-free, challenging, and rewarding experience. Our top priority is to set mutually-agreed-upon goals about research, learning, and professional growth and then both do our best to make those goals reality. The following expectations are meant to encourage mutual accountability. We will go through and discuss these expectations at the beginning of your time in HEAL@KGS to make sure we are in agreement and modify if necessary.

## Everyone

 - Work hard and be careful. Don’t rush your work. Think about it. Double and triple check it. Incorporate sanity checks into your code. Do any data points look weird on your graph? Try to explain why they are where they are. Ask others to look at your code or data if you need help. It’s ok to makes mistakes, but mistakes shouldn’t be caused by carelessness or rushed work.
 - If you do make a mistake, tell your collaborators. This is true regardless of the stage a product is in, and especially true if the paper is being written up, is already submitted, or already accepted. To correct our mistakes, we need to admit them.
 - Be honest and have integrity. It is never ok to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in any way. Science is about finding out the truth, and null results and unexpected results are still important. This can’t be emphasized enough: no academic misconduct!
 - Support your colleagues. Help them out if they need help (even if you aren’t on the project), and let them vent when they need to. Science is collaborative, not competitive. Help others, and you can expect others to help you when you need it.
 - If you’re struggling, tell someone (feel free to tell Sam!). Your health and happiness come first. We will all look out for the well-being of everyone else. It’s ok to go through hard patches (we all do), but you shouldn’t feel shy about asking for help.
 - If there is any tension or hostility in the lab, something has to be done about it immediately. We can’t thrive in an environment we aren’t comfortable in, and disrespect or rudeness will not be tolerated in the lab. If you don’t feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell Sam. In any case, tell Sam.
 - If you have a problem with Sam and are comfortable telling him about it, please do! He has a thick skin and will not hold it against you. If you aren’t comfortable talking to Sam, talk to Annette Delaney (KGS human resources director) or someone else that you feel comfortable talking to.
 - Stay up to date on the latest research through journal table of contents and/or exploring citations in manuscripts you find interesting. You might keep up-to-date by following scientists in your field on Twitter, but don't let social media take over your work - focused time for [deep work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) is a better use of your time.
 - If you’re sick, stay home and take care of yourself. 
 - Be on time for your meetings and reschedule if you know you can't make it: respect that others have packed days and everyone’s time is valuable. 
 - Keep your office and any shared work spaces (conference room, kitchen, labs) tidy, clean, and uncluttered. Turn off the lights when you leave a room.
 - Backup your data and scripts regularly, and over-document them. See the ['Data Management' section](#data-management). 
 - Have a life outside of the lab, take care of your mental and physical health, and don’t ever feel bad for taking time off work. You are expected to get your work done (whatever time of day you like to do it). See the ['Work/life balance' section](#worklife-balance).

## Principal Investigator

All of the above, and I promise to also…
 - Care for your emotional and physical well-being, and prioritize that above all else
 - Give you feedback on a timely basis, including feedback on project ideas, conference posters, talks, manuscripts, figures, grants
 - Be available in person and via e-mail on a regular basis, including regular meetings to discuss your research (and anything else you’d like to discuss)
 - Give my perspective on where the lab is going, where the field is going, and tips about surviving and thriving in academia
 - Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, promoting your work at talks, writing recommendation letters for you, and letting you attend conferences as often as finances permit
 - Help you prepare for the next step of your career, whether it’s a post-doc, a faculty job, or a job outside of academia

## Post-Docs

All of the above, and you will also be expected to…
 - Develop your own independent line of research
 - Help train and mentor students in the lab (both undergraduate and graduate) when they need it – either because they ask, or because I ask you to
 - Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences
 - Apply for grants. Though I will only hire you if I can support you for at least one year, it’s in your best interest to get experience writing grants – and if you get them you’ll be helping out the entire lab as well as yourself (because you’ll free up funds previously allocated to you)
 - Apply for jobs (academic or otherwise) when you’re ready, but no later than the beginning of your final funded year as a post-doc. If you think you’d like to leave academia, that’s completely ok – but you should still treat your post-doc seriously, and talk to me about how to best train for a job outside academia
 - You were hired because you have unique skills and knowledge. Challenge me (Sam) when I’m wrong or when your opinion is different, and treat the rest of the lab to your unique expertise 

## Graduate Students

All of the above, and you will also be expected to…
 - Develop your thesis. In HEAL@KGS, we will write manuscript-based theses. A typical M.S. thesis will be 1-2 papers and a typical Ph.D. dissertation will be 3-4 papers. You are expected to be the intellectual leader of this work, but remember that others in lab (especially Sam!) are there to help you when you need it
 - Help mentor undergraduate students in the lab when they need it
 - Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences
 - Apply for grants. It’s a valuable experience, and best to get it early.
 - Think about what you want for your career (academia – research or teaching, industry, science writing, something else), and talk to Sam about it to make sure you’re getting the training you need for that career
 - Make sure you meet all departmental deadlines (e.g., for your exams and thesis), and make sure Sam and your academic supervisor are aware of them!
 - Prioritize time for research. Coursework and TAing are important, but ultimately your research gets you your graduate degree and prepares you for the next stage of your career.

## Undergraduate Students

All of the above, and you will also be expected to…
 - Assist other lab members with data collection and analysis (unless you are working on your own independent project, in which case you should work on that)
 - Develop your weekly schedule by talking to your mentor (a graduate student, a post-doc, or Sam). You should be coming in every week, and scheduling enough time to get your work done
 - If you are earning course credit for research, you must also attend lab meetings when your schedule permits, present at one of these lab meetings, and submit a write-up of your research by the end of the semester

## Visiting Scientists, Students, and Interns

All of the above, and you will also be expected to…
 - Share your expertise with other members of the lab - we are excited to have you as a guest and learn from you!
 - Make sure we can access your data/results when you leave the lab (see ['Data Management' section](#data-management))
 - Abide by the code of conduct

# Lab policies and guidelines

## Authorship
Authorship is an important consideration, particularly for lab members pursuing academic careers, so it is important to have clear standards to help us decide who will be an author, and in what order. All authors must have contributed intellectually to the work, provided critical and constructive review of manuscript drafts prior to submission, and must be able to explain and defend the work to colleagues or the public. 

Our goal is to be be inclusive of all project participants, to offer junior members leadership roles on papers, and to freely share our data. If you are leading a study or publication, you should provide opportunities for other people to contribute. If you are contributing to a publication, you should expect to be a co-author if you meet at least two of the following criteria: 
 - Significant intellectual contribution to the concept and hypotheses of the research 
 - Significant intellectual contribution to the design and presentation of the research and analyses 
 - Supervision regarding the organization and progress of the manuscript 
 - Provision of data, materials, or additional resources necessary for the project 
 - Responsibility for data collection, analysis, and presentation of results 
 - Substantial contribution in writing the manuscript (writing, figures, etc.) 

In the words of Steve Carpenter, "author is a verb". 

## Data management
An estimated [17% of scientific data 'disappears' per year](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213014000) due to inadequate data archiving and documentation. We do not want any of our data to be included in that number. We use a broad definition of 'data management' to include raw data, processed data, code, model input/output files, written documents, and any other product that could conceivably be useful to someone else at any point in the future.

In the grand scheme of things, [your work isn't science if it's not reproducible](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016WR019285). Everyone's data and code organization approach will be different based on the needs and approach of their work. However, as a big-picture goal, we are working towards the idea of a 'clickable paper'. What does this mean? If someone is interested enough in our results to want to dig into the data, we need to make that as easy as possible for them. Within 1 hour, they should be able to download all data and code and re-make any figure on their own machine. Within 2 hours, they should be able to change any step in the analysis workflow to see how that impacts the results. 

Some key principles and notes for data management in HEAL@KGS:
 - Talk with Sam early and often about your data management plan and organization. Sam is working on a standardized data organization system to bridge our diverse projects which will be implemented on the Geohydrology Section Snap Server.
 - The biggest beneficiary of well-organized and well-documented data is *you*. You will inevitably have to re-make figures for publication, re-analyze results with different methods, etc. That is quick and easy with well-organized data, and a nightmare with poorly-organized data.
 - The University of Kansas provides [1 TB free storage on OneDrive](https://technology.ku.edu/services/onedrive-business) – you should use it. If your computer explodes overnight, you should be able to install OneDrive on a new computer and be up and running within twenty minutes.
 - Over-document your workflows. Imagine that someone wants to follow your same method in a different project in 15 years. You should be able to send them a document with step-by-step instructions.
 - Use version control tools like [git](https://git-scm.com/). Don't know how to use it? Now's the time to learn. Check out [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) resources.

## Work/life balance

Lab members are welcome to work flexibly for any reason. There are some activities which require coordinated schedules (i.e,. group meetings and meetings with Sam/other group members/collaborators). Other than these, we are each welcome to work when it is best for us bsaed on our diverse personal situations. This may mean people send work-related emails during non-traditional work hours (evenings, weekends), but remember that you are not required to read or reply outside of your own typical work hours. It is helpful if other lab members know generally when you will be working to avoid bothering you during your time off. 

Similarly, taking vacations is normal and encouraged. In additional to state holidays, the North American standard of 2 weeks/year is a minimum and additional time is possible if you are making sufficient progress. You are expected to keep track of your own vacation time and let people know when you are going to be gone prior to your departure. You can use your vacation time during breaks in the academic calendar (such as spring break) if you want.

*If you struggle with working flexibly - working too much, working too little, feeling directionless - let Sam know and we can develop a work plan together.*

To understand how much I (Sam) am working and whether I am using my time effectively, [I log all my work hours (by activity)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I4kUeZEEtup1e7Wd3PSqfBpaHyK6ntcL18Dz2zYSCfs/edit?usp=sharing). There are things I am good at (not working much in evenings/weekends) and things I still need to improve (I often check my email or do little tasks on weekends when I should be taking time off). I encourage everyone to track their own hours since it is very interesting and can help diagnose problems such as ineffective time management.
