# Opportunities with HEAL@KGS

We love working with new people and value the skills that all members of HEAL@KGS bring to the table. There are numerous ways to join the group, whether you are based in Kansas or elsewhere. Please see below for opportunities at the undergraduate, graduate, postdoc, and visiting scientist levels. 

Before you get in touch, please read [this article](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2015/05/dear-dr-neufeld) and [this blog post](https://contemplativemammoth.com/2013/04/08/so-you-want-to-go-to-grad-school-nail-the-inquiry-email/) for how to email a prospective advisor. While they are targeted towards people seeking graduate degrees, the points are relevant for people interested in any type of position.

## Internships (undergrad/grad student or recent graduates)
The KGS [Geohydrology Internship Program](http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Hydro/gipIndex.html) typically hires several **paid interns** each summer to contribute to a variety of ongoing projects. These internships are open to students or recent graduates from any institution and will pay $15/hr for a 12-week summer research experience. Advertisements are typically posted in January/February with a May/June start date. You can [sign up here](http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Hydro/gipIndex.html) to be notified when new positions are posted.

## Undergrads
We often have undergraduate research opportunities spring up through various funding sources. If you are interested in gaining research experience, please [get in touch]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}) and we can figure out the best options regarding research projects and funding sources.

## Graduate Students
 - I can advise students through the [KU Department of Geology](https://geo.ku.edu/) or the [KU Department of Geography and Atmospheric Science](https://geog.ku.edu/) depending on student interests and programmatic fit.I am always happy to work with students on developing proposals for external funding, such as the [NSF GRFP](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/), [USDA Predoctoral Fellowship](https://nifa.usda.gov/funding-opportunity/agriculture-and-food-research-initiative-education-workforce-development), or internal KU fellowships, such as the [Self Fellowship](https://selfgraduate.ku.edu). If you are interested, please [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}).

## Postdocs
 There are no currently funded postdoctoral positions open to join HEAL. I would be excited to work together to develop a mutually agreeable project and identify a suitable funding body, such as:
 - [NSF Earth Sciences postdoctoral fellowship (EAR-PF)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144)
 - [SESYNC Socio-Environmental Immersion Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://www.sesync.org/opportunities/research-fellowships-postdoctoral-fellowships/socio-environmental-immersion-1)
 - [David H. Smith Conservation Research Fellowship](https://conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows) 
 - [Ford Foundation Fellowships](https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/index.htm)
 - [USDA Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://nifa.usda.gov/funding-opportunity/agriculture-and-food-research-initiative-education-workforce-development)

If you are interested, please [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}).

## Visiting Scientists
We love to collaborate and one of our favorite ways is to host visiting students and scientists from other institutions. Lawrence is a beautiful place to visit, whether for a week or a year. If you need a visa, sponsor, or any other paperwork, we are happy to work with you to set things up. We will arrange comfortable office space with plenty of coffee and good conversations for anyone who comes by for a visit! If you want to visit sometime, please [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}). 

# About KGS, KU, and Lawrence 
The [Kansas Geological Survey (KGS)](http://www.kgs.ku.edu/) is a research and service division of the [University of Kansas (KU)](https://www.ku.edu/), charged by the state legislature to "... conduct geological studies and research and ... collect, correlate, preserve, and disseminate information leading to a better understanding of the geology of Kansas, with special emphasis on natural resources of economic value, water quality and quantity, and geologic hazards." The HEAL@KGS group is part of the [Geohydrology Section](http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Hydro/hydroIndex.html) which focuses on better understanding the past, present, and future of Kansas' water resources. KGS is located on KU's West Campus, which is just across the street from main campus for easy collaboration.

KGS is located on the KU campus, which is situated on top of Mount Oread in Lawrence KS. KU is an international, R1 research university and the flagship university for the state of Kansas with a large water and environmental research community spread across campus. In HEAL@KGS we collaborate with faculty and students from many departments including including the [Geology](https://geo.ku.edu/); [Geography and Atmospheric Science](https://geog.ku.edu/); [Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering](https://ceae.ku.edu/); [ Ecology & Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.ku.edu/); and the [Kansas Biological Survey](http://biosurvey.ku.edu/).

We think you'll love Lawrence, which is an eclectic town of ~100,000 people along the banks of the beautiful Kansas River. Lawrence has an excellent cultural scene, historic downtown, cutting-edge library, and too many delicious restaurants to count. Outdoor opportunities around town including biking, hiking, and boating. The big-city vibes and international airport of Kansas City are less than an hour away.
