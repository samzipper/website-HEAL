# Currently open positions

I am currently searching for two M.S. students for projects integrating physical and social aspects of water science. For either position, if the project is successful and funding is available, the student may transition into a Ph.D. position if they are interested. In addition to project collaborators, all students in HEAL@KGS will get the chance to interact with diverse KGS scientists, technical staff, and various water decision-makers, thus preparing the student for a variety of different career paths in academia, government, and/or industry. 

Please see below for details and how to apply for each position. If you would like to apply for both positions, please submit a single file with the name: *LastName_FirstName_DISES+USDA.pdf*. Applications will be reviewed beginning **October 22** and advertisements will be removed as positions are filled.

## Position 1: USDA M.S. student (start in summer/fall 2022)
This position will support an M.S. student interested in developing improved water management decision support systems such as groundwater models. The student will lead groundwater modeling efforts on USDA-funded project seeking to better understand how groundwater model structure and results are represented, understood, and interpreted by water managers and water user decision-making, with a particular focus on the importance of uncertainty. Within the project, the M.S. research will relate uncertainty in groundwater model predictions to key management indicators such as surface and groundwater availability, and and work closely with other project students and researchers to connect these outcomes to water management and decision support. This position will be fully supported through a graduate research assistantship. The primary project collaborators are [Chloe Wardropper (Idaho)](https://chloewardropper.weebly.com/) and [Adam Zwickle (Michigan State)](https://cj.msu.edu/directory/zwickle-adam.html).

**Required Qualifications:** (i) Bachelor’s degree in a water-related science or engineering discipline, (ii) Experience with MODFLOW and/or other hydrological models, (iii) Proficiency in oral and written communication in English.

**Preferred Qualifications:** (i) Experience with coding (Python, R, etc.) and/or modeling approaches, (ii) Demonstrated ability to work effectively in an interdisciplinary team, (iii) Work experience related to groundwater modeling and/or water management.

**Start date:** Summer/Fall 2022. 

**To apply:** [Send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}) with the following items *as a single PDF attachment*, with the following file name format: *LastName_FirstName_USDA.pdf*:
 - Cover letter (max 2-page) detailing your interest in the position and how you meet the required and preferred qualifications.
 - Current resume/CV
 - Names/contact information for three references.
 - Unofficial transcripts

## Position 2: DISES M.S. student (start in January or summer 2022)
This position will support an M.S. student interested in applying cutting-edge hydrologic, agronomic, and data science techniques to address real-world challenges. The student will lead crop and water use modeling efforts on an [NSF-funded DISES project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2108196&HistoricalAwards=false) seeking to better understand social and environmental factors that contribute to sustainable and resilient groundwater-supported agricultural systems. Within the project, the M.S. research will help determine how crop yield and water use respond to different water and land management decisions, and work closely with other project students and scientists to connect these outcomes to water and social sustainability. [Here are more details about the project and collaborators](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CJUS2Gad1-Ss1akuvGKRHDkcSI76l9G6/view). This position will be fully supported through a graduate research assistantship. The student will be co-supervised by [Dr. Landon Marston (Virginia Tech)](http://marstonresearchgroup.com/).

**Required Qualifications:** (i) Bachelor’s degree in a water-related science or engineering discipline, (ii) Experience with coding (Python, R, etc.) and/or modeling approaches, (iii) Proficiency in oral and written communication in English.

**Preferred Qualifications:** (i) Demonstrated ability to work effectively in an interdisciplinary team, (ii) Experience working with geospatial data and/or GIS software; (iii) Experience working with crop models.

**Start date:** First half of 2022 (January or May/June). 

**To apply:** [Send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}) with the following items *as a single PDF attachment*, with the following file name format: *LastName_FirstName_DISES.pdf*:
 - Cover letter (max 2-page) detailing your interest in the position and how you meet the required and preferred qualifications.
 - Current resume/CV
 - Names/contact information for three references.

## Coming soon: postdoc and summer interns
We will also be hiring a postdoctoral scholar (start date late 2022/early 2023) and interns (each summer) associated with the [DISES project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2108196&HistoricalAwards=false).
 
 - *Postdoc:* The postdoctoral scholar will lead the development of an open source Crop-Hydrological-Agent Modeling Platform (CHAMP) that will couple together groundwater models, crop models, and agent-based models to investigate feedbacks and interactions among hydrologic, agronomic, and social systems. The postdoc and other project members will use CHAMP to evaluate factors affecting the resilience and sustainability of groundwater-dependent agriculture in Kansas and Colorado. Thus, the ideal candidate would have both strong technical skills for working with and coupling environmental models, as well as an interest in advancing social-environmental systems theory. More details on the hiring process will be available in late 2021/early 2022, but feel free to [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}) if you are interested.
  - *Internships:* The first position will be posted in January/February 2022, for a summer 2022 position. You can [sign up here](http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Hydro/gipIndex.html) to be notified when the application is open and learn more about the KGS internship program.

# Other opportunities with HEAL@KGS

# About KGS, KU, and Lawrence 
The [Kansas Geological Survey (KGS)](http://www.kgs.ku.edu/) is a research and service division of the [University of Kansas (KU)](https://www.ku.edu/), charged by the state legislature to "... conduct geological studies and research and ... collect, correlate, preserve, and disseminate information leading to a better understanding of the geology of Kansas, with special emphasis on natural resources of economic value, water quality and quantity, and geologic hazards." The HEAL@KGS group is part of the [Geohydrology Section](http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Hydro/hydroIndex.html) which focuses on better understanding the past, present, and future of Kansas' water resources. KGS is located on KU's West Campus, which is just across the street from main campus for easy collaboration.

KGS is located on the KU campus, which is situated on top of Mount Oread in Lawrence KS. KU is an international, R1 research university and the flagship university for the state of Kansas with a large water and environmental research community spread across campus. In HEAL@KGS we collaborate with faculty and students from many departments including including the [Geology](https://geo.ku.edu/); [Geography and Atmospheric Science](https://geog.ku.edu/); [Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering](https://ceae.ku.edu/); [ Ecology & Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.ku.edu/); and the [Kansas Biological Survey](http://biosurvey.ku.edu/).

We think you'll love Lawrence, which is an eclectic town of ~100,000 people along the banks of the beautiful Kansas River. Lawrence has an excellent cultural scene, historic downtown, cutting-edge library, and too many delicious restaurants to count. Outdoor opportunities around town including biking, hiking, and boating. The big-city vibes and international airport of Kansas City are less than an hour away.
