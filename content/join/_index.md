# Now hiring

Two open positions available:

 - *Postdoc starting mid/late 2023:* We will also need a postdoctoral scholar for a new USDA-funded project investigating how agriculture, water, and communities in the eastern Great Plains can manage and adapt to future climate conditions. These students will live, study, and conduct place-based research in the Kansas River Watershed to understand potential exposure to climate risks, agricultural water and land management practices, and resulting impacts on water resources and community resilience. As part of the project, students will work closely with each other and with a group of local stakeholders, and will receive training in interdisciplinary, solutions-oriented science. **[Click here for details and to apply](http://www.employment.ku.edu/staff/24327BR).**
 - *Interns, variety of projects, summer 2023:* The KGS [Geohydrology Internship Program](http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Hydro/gipIndex.html) typically hires several paid interns each summer to contribute to a variety of ongoing projects. **[Click here for details and to apply](http://www.employment.ku.edu/staff/24185BR).**

Details will be posted to this page when positions are open, but feel free to [send Sam an email]({{< ref "/authors/samuel-c.-zipper" >}}) if you are interested.

# About KGS, KU, and Lawrence 
The [Kansas Geological Survey (KGS)](http://www.kgs.ku.edu/) is a research and service division of the [University of Kansas (KU)](https://www.ku.edu/), charged by the state legislature to "... conduct geological studies and research and ... collect, correlate, preserve, and disseminate information leading to a better understanding of the geology of Kansas, with special emphasis on natural resources of economic value, water quality and quantity, and geologic hazards." The HEAL@KGS group is part of the [Geohydrology Section](http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Hydro/hydroIndex.html) which focuses on better understanding the past, present, and future of Kansas' water resources. KGS is located on KU's West Campus, which is just across the street from main campus for easy collaboration.

KGS is located on the KU campus, which is situated on top of Mount Oread in Lawrence KS. KU is an international, R1 research university and the flagship university for the state of Kansas with a large water and environmental research community spread across campus. In HEAL@KGS we collaborate with faculty and students from many departments including including the [Geology](https://geo.ku.edu/); [Geography and Atmospheric Science](https://geog.ku.edu/); [Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering](https://ceae.ku.edu/); [ Ecology & Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.ku.edu/); and the [Kansas Biological Survey](http://biosurvey.ku.edu/).

We think you'll love Lawrence, which is an eclectic town of ~100,000 people along the banks of the beautiful Kansas River. Lawrence has an excellent cultural scene, historic downtown, cutting-edge library, and too many delicious restaurants to count. Outdoor opportunities around town including biking, hiking, and boating. The big-city vibes and international airport of Kansas City are less than an hour away.
