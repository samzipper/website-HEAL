abstract: "Climate change is increasingly impacting water availability. National-scale hydrologic models simulate streamflow resulting from many important processes, but often without processes such as human water use and management activities. This work explores and tests methods to account for such omitted processes using one national-scale hydrologic model. Two bias correction methods, Flow Duration Curve (FDC) and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), are tested on streamflow simulated by the US Geological Survey National Hydrologic Model (NHM-PRMS), which omits irrigation pumping. A semi-arid agricultural case study is used. FDC and ARIMA perform better for correcting low and high flows, respectively. A hybrid method performs well at both low and high flows; typical Nash-Sutcliffe values increased from <-1.00 to about 0.75. Results suggest methods with which national-scale hydrologic models can be bias-corrected for omitted processes to improve regional streamflow estimates. Utility of these correction methods in simulation of future projections is discussed."
