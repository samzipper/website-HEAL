	abstract = {Groundwater, Earthâ€™s largest nonfrozen freshwater reservoir, is vital for water supply security. Groundwater models help to manage complex domestic, agricultural, and industrial water demands while preserving ecosystem health under climate change. The community-driven groundwater model portal (GroMoPo) hosts groundwater model metadata to analyse biases and distribution of groundwater models. Over 450 models are currently featured on GroMoPo, with most models from high-GDP countries at local-to-regional scales. The GroMoPo initiative addresses current knowledge gaps and facilitates future collaboration and data sharing.},
