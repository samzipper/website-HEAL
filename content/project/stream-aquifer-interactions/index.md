Groundwater pumping can cause reductions in streamflow, but attributing changes in streamflow to groundwater pumping is difficult because these changes are superimposed on weather-driven variability in streamflow and there may be long lags between pumping and hydrologic change.

Ongoing work in this area focuses on developing [simple, user-friendly tools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/streamDepletr/index.html) for estimating streamflow depletion due to groundwater pumping and [quantifying streamflow depletion across the US](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/powell-ctr/science/visualizing-invisible-causes-consequences-changes-and-management?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects).

Key past findings:
 - Relatively simple, empirical extensions of traditional analytical models produce comparable streamflow depletion estimates to complex numerical models ([Zipper et al., 2018]({{< ref "/publication/zipper-groundwater-2018" >}}); [Zipper et al., 2019]({{< ref "/publication/zipper-rapid-2019" >}})).
 - Urbanization and cannabis cultivation have significant potential impacts on streamflow depletion in California's Navarro River Watershed ([Zipper et al., 2019]({{< ref "/publication/ZipperEtAl-2019-NavarroCannabis" >}})).
