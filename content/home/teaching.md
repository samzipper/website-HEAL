I've had the privilege to teach at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. From this diverse experience, I've developed a learner-focused teaching style underlain by three core principles:
1. Students learn best when materials connect to the things they care about. 
2. Active student participation in the classroom is necessary to engage students.
3. Regular internal and external assessment is necessary in order to identify what material students are connecting with, and where they are struggling. 

I use place-based teaching as the thread binding these three principles together. By using local examples, experiential field education, and real-world data, students build upon their sense of place to make connections between new material and their existing knowledge.
