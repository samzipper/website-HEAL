I've had the privilege to teach at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. From this diverse experience, I've developed a learner-focused teaching style underlain by three core principles:
1. Students learn best when materials connect to the things they care about. 
2. Active student participation in the classroom is necessary to engage students.
3. Regular internal and external assessment is necessary in order to identify what material students are connecting with, and where they are struggling. 

I use place-based teaching as the thread binding these three principles together. By using local examples, experiential field education, and real-world data, students build upon their sense of place to make connections between new material and their existing knowledge.

**Courses Taught**
 - *Sustainable Water Resources*, University of Victoria (CIVE340), Fall 2018. Instructor for core undergraduate water resource engineering course. Leading all lectures, in-class activities, homework assignments, and exams. Selected evaluation results (n=48):
	- 'Overall, the instructor was effective in this course': 60% Excellent, 35% Good.
	- 'As a result of this course, my interest in the material...': 63% Increased.

**Courses TA'ed**
 - *Ecohydrology*, University of Wisconsin (CEE619), Spring 2016. Developed new module on rainfall-runoff partitioning including student programming exercise simulating banded vegetation dynamics. Lectured on various topics in class and assisted with curriculum design.
 - *Ecohidrologia (Ecohydrology)*, Universidad Nacional de San Luis (Argentina), Spring 2015. Led student development of ecohydrological ‘bucket model’ in programming language R.
