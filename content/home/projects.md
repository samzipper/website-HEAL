The HEAL group is focused on the question, **How do water and land management decisions impact the people, economy, and environment of the Great Plains?** 

Methodologically, we use a combination of numerical modelling, field research, and remote sensing to quantify the movement of water and energy across the groundwater-vadose zone-stream-land surface continuum known as the ‘critical zone’, with a specialty in agricultural landscapes. We are deliberately transdisciplinary and link our technical ecohydrological research to improved understanding of human decision-making and management practices. 

Here are some core topics we are currently working on. We have many varied interests, so please see our [Publications](publication) for everything that doesn't fit into one of these categories!
