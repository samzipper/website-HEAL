*Transparency | Accessibility | Outreach*

Science should be transparent and accessible to all. To support this, I actively participate in the Open Science movement through multiple avenues:
 - **Open Software and Code.** I post all code to online repositories, primarily my [GitHub page](https://www.github.com/samzipper). I use open-source software ([R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [python](https://www.python.org/), [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/)) to facilitate code sharing and have created and released several open source tools:
   - [streamDepletr R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=streamDepletr), containing tools for streamflow depletion modeling.
   - [AgroStream](https://github.com/samzipper/AgroStream), a program to collect agricultural tweets described in [Zipper (2018)](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/aj/articles/110/1/349).
   - High Resolution Mapping of EvapoTranspiration (HRMET) surface energy balance model, described in [Zipper & Loheide (2014)](publication/zipper-using-2014/), is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/samzipper/HRMET) for both R and MATLAB.
   - I also work with community code resources, and am the co-curator of a community database of the [CRAN Hydrology Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Hydrology.html) of water-related R packages. Contribute via [GitHub here](https://github.com/ropensci/Hydrology/)!
 - **Shared Data.** All data are shared, mostly via the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/jx68u/) or [community and institutional repositories](https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/power-search/data-set?search_api_views_fulltext=Zipper).
   - I am also active in the ethics of data sharing and led a collaborative effort to outline best practices for ['Balancing Open Science and Data Privacy in the Water Sciences'](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019WR025080).
 - **No Paywalls.** I am a community ambassador for [EarthArXiv](https://eartharxiv.org/), an earth sciences preprint server and part of the Open Science Framework. I [post all manuscripts to EarthArXiv](https://osf.io/jx68u/) to share the evolution of projects, and publish in open-access venues when I have enough funding.
 - **Accessibility.** To make science accessible to all, I take a variety of steps including providing [captions for all video content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaTFs6VEpTU), using [colorblind-friendly palettes](https://sashat.me/2017/01/11/list-of-20-simple-distinct-colors/) on slides and figures, creating alt-text for images, and formatting documents for text-to-voice compatibility.
 - **Outreach.** Science is not just for academics, but the interested public as well. I am...
   - I am a regular blogger for [Water Underground](https://blogs.agu.org/waterunderground/) (part of the AGU and EGU Blog Networks)
   - Actively [engaged on scientific Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ZipperSam) personally, and run the [AGU Ecohydrology Technical Committee social media accounts](https://twitter.com/AGUecohydro).
   - Involved in a variety of community outreach events in person and online, such as [Skype A Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com/).
 - **Skill-sharing.** Together with [Sheila Saia](https://github.com/sheilasaia/agu-2019-coding-help-desk), I've co-organized the AGU Fall Meeting [Coding Help Desk](https://github.com/sheilasaia/agu-2019-coding-help-desk) in the student center Fall Meeting since 2018. I've recently been trying to write up random methods and techniques I use in case it happens to help anyone. For example, here's a post on extracting and plotting your citation data from Google Scholar.

What more can I do? I am always looking for ways to improve... Tweet [@ZipperSam](https://www.twitter.com/ZipperSam) with ideas!
