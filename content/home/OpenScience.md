Science should be transparent and accessible to all. To support this, we actively participate in the Open Science movement through multiple avenues:
 - **Open Software and Code:** 
   - Sam's [GitHub](https://www.github.com/samzipper) including all ongoing projects.
   - [streamDepletr R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=streamDepletr), containing tools for streamflow depletion modeling.
   - [AgroStream](https://github.com/samzipper/AgroStream) program for scraping agricultural tweets described in [Zipper (2018)](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/aj/articles/110/1/349).
   - [High Resolution Mapping of EvapoTranspiration (HRMET)](https://github.com/samzipper/HRMET) surface energy balance model for R and MATLAB.
   - Co-curator of [CRAN Hydrology Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Hydrology.html) synthesizing water-related R packages. Contribute via [GitHub here](https://github.com/ropensci/Hydrology/)!
 - **Sharing Data:** 
   - [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/jx68u/) including code and data for publications.
   - [Community and institutional repositories](https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/power-search/data-set?search_api_views_fulltext=Zipper) for project-specific data.
   - Active in the ethics of data sharing and led a collaborative effort to outline best practices for ['Balancing Open Science and Data Privacy in the Water Sciences'](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019WR025080).
 - **No Paywalls:** 
   - [Pre-prints of all manuscripts to EarthArXiv](https://osf.io/jx68u/).
   - Publish in open-access venues when funding permits.
 - **Accessibility:** 
   - Providing [captions for all video content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaTFs6VEpTU)
   - Using [colorblind-friendly palettes](https://sashat.me/2017/01/11/list-of-20-simple-distinct-colors/) on slides and figures
   - Formatting [manuscripts](https://osf.io/jx68u/) for text-to-voice compatibility.
 - **Outreach:** 
   - Blogger for AGU/EGU [Water Underground](https://blogs.agu.org/waterunderground/) blog.
   - Actively [engaged on scientific Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ZipperSam).
   - Run the [AGU Ecohydrology Technical Committee social media accounts](https://twitter.com/AGUecohydro).
   - Community outreach events in person and online, such as [Skype A Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com/).
 - **Skill-sharing:** 
   - Co-organizer of AGU [Coding Help Desk](https://github.com/sheilasaia/agu-2019-coding-help-desk) in Student Center since 2018 (with [Sheila Saia](https://github.com/sheilasaia/agu-2019-coding-help-desk)).
   - Recently been trying to write up random methods and techniques on the HEAL blog.

What more can I do? I am always looking for ways to improve... Tweet [@ZipperSam](https://www.twitter.com/ZipperSam) with ideas!
