I've contributed to numerous projects as a consultant, working with diverse groups including [The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/), [Foundry Spatial](https://foundryspatial.com/), [Dairy Management Inc.](https://www.usdairy.com/about-us/dmi), and the [Soil Health Institute](https://soilhealthinstitute.org/). 

As an independent freelancer, I provide exceptional value to your project since my overhead costs are effectively zero - all you pay for is the time I spend doing science for you. 

Past work has ranged from a handful of hours to multi-year collaborative projects. My services include:
 - strategic planning and fundraising
 - project design
 - data collection and analysis
 - modeling and data science
 - scientific and technical writing

If you could benefit from any of these services, please contact me using the form below and I'm happy to develop a scope of work that meets your needs and budget.
