The goal of the KGS HydroEcology of Anthropogenic Landscapes (HEAL) research group, led by [Sam Zipper](authors/sam-zipper), is to understand how local, regional, and global change can and will affect the water resources of Kansas and the Great Plains region now and in the future. Our science will be useful, intelligible, and actionable for diverse stakeholders including policymakers, the agricultural industry, conservation groups, and city planners. In addition to local research, we seek to understand how socio-environmental systems around the world experience and respond to similar water challenges to those facing the Great Plains today and connect these global insights to local issues. To accomplish this mission, we will collaborate with physical and social scientists around the world in addition to local stakeholders; [share scientific methods, tools, and results openly](#OpenScience); and continually move towards the intersection of scientific novelty and societal relevance.
